Coder running on VM is working almost without any issues.
The installation runs with a single command:
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh

There is only to install:
- DockerCE
- Terraform (to avoid warnings while starting Coder)
- Run: coder server and check the "exposed" url

Create a template with Docker and create workspace.
