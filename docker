Install Docker CE and Docker compose on RHEL 8 or RHEL 9 using dnf commands

Before you begin: You need a valid Red Hat subscription and account credentials to perform these actions. For detailed prerequisites, refer to Prerequisites and requirements.

To install Docker CE and Docker compose on RHEL 8:

    Add a subscription on a RHEL 8 system. To do that, complete the following steps:
        Register the system:

        sudo subscription-manager register

        This command prompts you to enter your Red Hat account credentials. After successful registration, the system is associated with your Red Hat account.
        Refresh:

        sudo subscription-manager refresh

        This command manually refreshes the local system's subscription information.
        Attach a subscription:

        sudo subscription-manager attach --auto

        This command automatically attaches available subscriptions to your system.

    Add the external repository by running the following command.

    sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

        Verify whether the repository has been enabled. To do that, run the following command that returns detailed information about all the enabled repositories.

        sudo dnf repolist -v

    Install docker-ce with the --nobest option. With this option, the first version of docker-ce with satisfiable dependencies is selected as the "fallback" version.

    sudo dnf install --nobest docker-ce-rootless-extras-24.0.7
