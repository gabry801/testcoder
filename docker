Install Docker CE and Docker compose on RHEL 8 or RHEL 9 using dnf commands

Before you begin: You need a valid Red Hat subscription and account credentials to perform these actions. For detailed prerequisites, refer to Prerequisites and requirements.

To install Docker CE and Docker compose on RHEL 8:

    Add a subscription on a RHEL 8 system. To do that, complete the following steps:
        Register the system:

        sudo subscription-manager register

        This command prompts you to enter your Red Hat account credentials. After successful registration, the system is associated with your Red Hat account.
        Refresh:

        sudo subscription-manager refresh

        This command manually refreshes the local system's subscription information.
        Attach a subscription:

        sudo subscription-manager attach --auto

        This command automatically attaches available subscriptions to your system.
    For more details on adding a subscription on a RHEL 8 system, see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/253273
    Add the external repository by running the following command.

    sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

        Verify whether the repository has been enabled. To do that, run the following command that returns detailed information about all the enabled repositories.

        sudo dnf repolist -v

    Install docker-ce with the --nobest option. With this option, the first version of docker-ce with satisfiable dependencies is selected as the "fallback" version.

    sudo dnf install --nobest docker-ce-rootless-extras-24.0.7

    Install the latest available containerd.io package manually

    sudo dnf install https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/containerd.io-1.2.6-3.3.el7.x86_64.rpm

    Install the latest docker-ce version:

    sudo dnf install docker-ce

    Start and enable the docker daemon

    sudo systemctl enable --now docker

        Confirm whether the daemon is active by running this command:

        systemctl is-active docker

    Install docker-compose globally.
        Download the binary file from the projectâ€™s GitHub page:

        curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o docker-compose

        After the binary file is downloaded, move it to the /usr/local/bin folder, and then make it executable:

        sudo mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
