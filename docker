Installing Terraform on CentOS 8

CentOS 8 does not include the Terraform package in its repository. Therefore, we need to add the HashiCorp repository using the yum-utils package and then install Terraform using the yum package manager.
Adding the HashiCorp Repository

To add the HashiCorp repository to your system, run the following command:

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo

This command configures your system to access the HashiCorp repository.
Verifying the Repository

To verify if the HashiCorp repository has been added successfully, run the following command:

sudo dnf repolist

You should see the HashiCorp repository listed in the output.
Installing Terraform

Now that the repository is set up, we can proceed with the installation. Run the following command to install Terraform:

sudo yum install terraform -y
